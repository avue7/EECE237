The 'Blinky' project is a simple demo program for
ST 'STM32F303VC' microcontroller using ST 'STM32F3-Discovery' Evaluation Board.
Compliant to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS).

Example functionality:
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL (ST-Link) =    8.00 MHz
   - SYSCLK         =   72.00 MHz

 - 8 LEDs blink with a fixed speed, determined by SysTick Timer
     working in interrupt mode
 - if Button USER is pressed all LEDs are lit.



The Blinky program is available in different targets:

  STM32F303 Flash:    configured for on-chip Flash
                      (used for production or target debugging)

  STM32F303 RAM:      configured for on-chip RAM
                      (used for target debugging)
